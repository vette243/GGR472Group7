# GGR472 Group 7 Final Project 

Tourism Web Map in Toronto 

In order to revive the tourism economy in Toronto from the negative effects of COVID - 19, we created a web map that includes three tourism components: 
    - Cultural attraction points (To promote Toronto's Art installations)
    - TTC Subway lines (To promote environmentally - safe travel)
    - Public Parks (To promote environment - related tourism spots)

Data sources: 
    Cultural Attractions (Economic Development and Culture, 2022)
    Green spaces (Parks, Forestry, and Recreation, 2022)
    TTC Subway lines (Toronto Transit Commission, 2019)
    TTC Subway Stations (ESRI Online, n.d.)
