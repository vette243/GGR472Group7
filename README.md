Tourism Web Map in Toronto 

In order to revive the tourism economy in Toronto from the negative effects of COVID - 19, we created a web map that includes three tourism components: 
    - Cultural attraction points (To promote Toronto's Art installations)
    - TTC Subway lines (To promote environmentally - safe travel)
    - Public Parks (To promote environment - related tourism spots)
